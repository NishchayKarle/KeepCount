# KeepCount Support Information

## Overview
**KeepCount** is a macOS menu bar application designed to let users effortlessly manage and track multiple counters for various tasks directly from the menu bar. It provides a simple, intuitive interface for counting items like daily tasks, project milestones, or personal habits.

## Key Features
- **Multiple Counters:** Users can manage multiple counters simultaneously, each with its unique settings and display.
- **Count Up/Down:** Each counter can be configured to count upwards or downwards, starting from a user-defined initial value.
- **Interactive Configuration:** Users can adjust the title, starting value, and counting direction through a user-friendly configuration window.
- **Visibility and Accessibility:** Designed to ensure clear visibility and accessibility, adapting to macOS light and dark modes.
- **Dynamic Menu Bar Integration:** Counters are displayed as individual status items in the macOS menu bar, avoiding the notch on newer MacBook Pros.

## Installation
1. Download "KeepCount" from the Mac App Store.
2. Open the application; there will be a menu to add Counters.
3. Click the menu bar icon for the Counter to add more or reset your counters.

## Usage

- **Closing Counters:** Choose "Close Tracker" from a counter's menu to remove it from the menu bar.

## Known Issues
